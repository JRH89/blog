# Introduction

Git is a powerful version control system that helps you manage changes to your codebase. This guide will take you from understanding basic Git concepts to mastering intermediate-level features, including branching strategies, resolving conflicts, and adhering to best practices for commit messages.

# Git Basics

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your codebase, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other. It provides a history of changes, facilitates collaboration, and supports various workflows.

>Git is a distributed version control system, meaning every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history, allowing offline work.

## Installing Git

To get started with Git, you need to install it on your machine:

- Windows: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win.
- macOS: Use Homebrew with `brew install` git or download from https://git-scm.com/download/mac.
- Linux: Install via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install git` for Ubuntu).

>The "index" or "staging area" in Git is a file that contains a snapshot of the changes that will be committed. It allows you to prepare commits incrementally.
>

## Basic Git Commands

Here are some of the most common Git commands you'll use frequently:

- Initialize a repository:

```bash
git init
```

- Clone a repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
``` 

- Check repository status:

```bash
git status
```

- Add changes to the staging area:

```bash
git add <file>
``` 

- Commit changes: 

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

- View commit history:

```bash
git log
``` 

- Push changes to a remote repository:

```bash
git push
```

- Pull changes from a remote repository:

```bash
git pull
``` 

>Git uses a hash function (SHA-1) to uniquely identify commits. This makes it nearly impossible for two commits to have the same hash.

## Branching Strategies

Branching allows you to work on different features or fixes independently. Here’s a guide to common branching strategies:

### Creating and Switching Branches

- Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

- Switch to a branch:

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
``` 

- Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

### Merging Branches

- Merge a branch into the current branch:

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

- Rebase a branch onto the current branch:

```bash
git rebase <branch_name>
```

### Deleting Branches

- Delete a branch:

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

- Delete multiple branches:

```bash
git branch -D <branch_name>
```

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

When merging branches, conflicts may arise if changes overlap. Here’s how to resolve them:

1. Git will mark the conflicting files. Open the files and look for conflict markers (e.g., `<<<<<<< HEAD`).

2. Edit the file to resolve conflicts by choosing or combining the changes.

3. Add the resolved files to the staging area:

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

4. Commit the resolution:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <file_name>"
```

## Best Practices for Commit Messages

Good commit messages make it easier to understand the history of changes. Follow these best practices:

- Use a short, descriptive summary (50 characters or less).

- Include a more detailed description if necessary (use 72-character line length).

- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

**Example**:

```sql
Add user authentication

Implemented login and registration functionality using JWT. Updated database schema to include user credentials.
```

>Git's branching model is designed to make it easy to create and merge branches, supporting various workflows and allowing for complex feature development and experimentation.

## FAQ


**What is a commit?**

A commit is a snapshot of your changes in the repository. Each commit has a unique ID and contains information about the changes made.

**How do I undo a commit?**

To undo the most recent commit but keep the changes in your working directory:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

To undo the most recent commit and discard changes:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**How do I view differences between commits?**

Use the git diff command:

```bash
git diff <commit_id> <commit_id>
```

**What is a pull request?**

A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another, often used in collaborative workflows to review and discuss changes before merging.

**How do I stash changes?**

To temporarily save changes and revert to the last commit:

```bash
git stash
``` 

To apply stashed changes:

```bash
git stash apply
```

**How do I delete a branch?**

- Delete a local branch:

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

- Delete a remote branch:

```bash
git push origin --delete <branch_name>
```

**How do I rename a branch?**

- Rename a local branch:

```bash
git branch -m <old_branch_name> <new_branch_name>
```

- Rename a remote branch:

```bash
git push origin <old_branch_name>:<new_branch_name>
```

## Code Snippets

### Basic Git Workflow

1. Start a new project:

```bash
git init
```

2. Add and commit changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

3. Push to remote:

```bash
git remote add origin <repository_url>
git push -u origin master
```

### Creating a Feature Branch

1. Create and switch to a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

2. Make changes, add, and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

3. Push the feature branch to remote:

```bash
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

4. Merge feature branch into master:

```bash
git checkout master
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin master
```
